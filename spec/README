Magnetism is a Rails engine. To properly test it, it needs to be part of a Rails application.

The "app_root" is a stock Rails app with the magnetism gem required. All spec files and factories
live within "app_root/spec"

All migrations/schema are kept within Magnetism so to prep your test database please do the following:

  $ RAILS_ENV=test rake magnetism:schema

Once your test database is ready, you can run the specs as you normally would:

  $ rspec spec
