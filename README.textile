h1. Magnetism

Magnetism is a website CMS. Its currently under heavy development and is not yet production ready.

For those that have been watching Magnetism, it has been converted into a gem. To get it up and
running please do the following:

<pre><code>
  # make a new rails instance
  $ rails new magnetism_demo

  # add two gems to your Gemfile
  gem 'magnetism', :git => 'git://github.com/daneharrigan/magnetism.git', :branch => 'development'
  gem 'liquify', :git => 'git://github.com/daneharrigan/liquify.git', :branch => 'master'

  # bundle everything up
  $ bundle install

  # install magnetism
  $ rails g magnetism:install

  # setup magnetism
  $ rake m:setup
</code></pre>
You can now launch the rails server and navigate to localhost:3000/admin

h3. Magnetism and Liquify?

Liquify is a wrapper to the popular Liquid templating engine. It's being developed at the same time
as Magnetism so updates for both happen frequently.
